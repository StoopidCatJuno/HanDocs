# Welcome!

This site will serve as a reference point for troubleshooting, and is a simplified, streamlined version of Benacle's Face Tracking Docs, found [here](https://docs.vrcft.io/). If you need some documentation that's more simplified, and that focuses primarily on **basic avatar setup**, you've come to the right place!
