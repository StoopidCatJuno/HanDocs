# Welcome!

This site will serve as a reference point for troubleshooting, and is a simplified, streamlined version of Benacle's Face Tracking Docs, found [here](https://docs.vrcft.io/). If you need some documentation that's more simplified, and that focuses primarily on **basic avatar setup**, you've come to the right place!

## Blendshapes, OSC, What's going on?!

This may all be overwhelming for a first-timer, and that's completely okay! I was in the same boat when I first got my headset, and I had slammed my head onto my desk trying to understand it all. Here's a rundown of some common terms you may run into, whether they're here or elsewhere:

- OSC
- FT
- Parameters
- Blendshapes/Shape Keys

## Getting Started

For anything with **Face Tracking (FT)**, you need some prerequisite addons to make sure everything works as smoothly as possible. This can include (but not limited to):

- Face Tracking Templates
  - These are used in Unity, and are responsible for controlling **blendshapes** on your avatars. They come with the proper parameters for receiving **OSC** input, and preset animations to drive all the shapes on your model!
- Parameter Mergers
  - This most notably refers to **VRCFury**, a popular tool used to automate and non-destructively automate the process of building avatars. 
### What you'll need

- The latest version of **Unity Editor**
- VRChat Creator Companion (VCC)
- A premade avatar base
